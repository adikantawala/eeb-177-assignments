I uploaded the code but I can't get the homework file to knit for some readon to display the images. I am getting an error saying "Error: stat_count() mut not be used with y aesthetic. Execution halted" I tried removing those lines and commenting them out and running all the code again but it is still not working. Will try and resolve later in office hours
